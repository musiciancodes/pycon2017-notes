# PyCon 2017 Notes

These are my notes from PyCon 2017 in Portland, OR; I try to give credit to the speakers and link to their public web presence when possible, and sometimes I annotate with extra information.

Pull requests welcome, and feel free to fork. I'm [@y3l2n](http://twitter.com/y3l2n) if you want to ping me.
